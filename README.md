## Usage

### Generating an Encryption Key
To generate a new encryption key, use the following command:

```bash
SeldeanCrypt -o {OUTPUT_KEY_FILE} generate-key
```

**Example:**
```bash
SeldeanCrypt -o MY_KEY.KEYFILE generate-key
```

### Encrypting a File
To encrypt a file, use the following command structure:

```bash
SeldeanCrypt -i {INPUT_FILE} -o {OUTPUT_FILE} -k {KEY_FILE} encrypt
```

**Example:**
```bash
SeldeanCrypt -i FamilyPhoto.png -o EncryptedFile.file -k MY_KEY.KEYFILE encrypt
```

### Decrypting a File
To decrypt a file, use the following command structure:

```bash
SeldeanCrypt -i {INPUT_FILE} -o {OUTPUT_FILE} -k {KEY_FILE} decrypt
```

**Example:**
```bash
SeldeanCrypt -i EncryptedFile.file -o DecryptedPhoto.png -k MY_KEY.KEYFILE decrypt
```

### Key Management

#### Viewing the Key
You can view the contents of your key file using the `cat` command:

```bash
cat MY_KEY.KEYFILE
```

#### Sharing the Key
The key is a plaintext file, making it easy to share. Hereâ€™s how to recreate the key file:

1. **Using `echo`:**
   ```bash
   echo "{YOUR_KEY}" > NEW_KEY.KEYFILE
   ```

2. **Using `touch` and `echo`:**
   ```bash
   touch NEW_KEY.KEYFILE
   echo "{YOUR_KEY}" > NEW_KEY.KEYFILE
   ```

Alternatively, you can share the `.KEYFILE` directly.

### Encrypting Multiple Files
To encrypt multiple files with a single key, first package them into an archive using formats like `.ZIP`, `.TAR`, or `.RAR`. Then, encrypt the archive using SeldeanCrypt.

## Notes

- **Security:** Treat your key file as sensitive information. Anyone with access to the key can decrypt your files.
- **Backup:** Always keep a backup of your key file. Losing the key means losing access to your encrypted data.

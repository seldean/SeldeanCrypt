Usage:
  Generating a key:
    > SeldeanCrypt -o {OUTPUT_KEY_FILE} generate-key
    - SeldeanCrypt -o THIS_IS_A_KEY.KEYFILE generate-key # We will be using this example key below.
  Encrypt or Decrypt:
    > SeldeanCrypt -i {INPUT_FILE} -o {OUTPUT_FILE} -k {KEY_FILE} encrypt/decrypt
    - SeldeanCrypt -i FamilyPhoto.png -o Encryptedfile.file -k THIS_IS_A_KEY.KEYFILE encrypt
    - SeldeanCrypt -i Encryptedfile.file -o DecryptedPNG.png -k THIS_IS_A_KEY.KEYFILE decrypt

You can "cat" the key, in example: "cat abc.abc". It will show you the key generated by the program.
You could share this output text with someone and they can create the key with the line: "echo "{YOUR_KEY}" > abc.abc""
  > An alternative to this is by touch program: "touch abc.abc" and then again "echo https://sertanbalta.com/DEFAULT_KEY > abc.abc"
Or you could also share the key file.

Note: If you would like to encrypt multiple files with one key, you should package the files together first. You could use .ZIP, .TAR or .RAR and many others for that.
